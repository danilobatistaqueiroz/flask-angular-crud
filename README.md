### Pipenv

The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:  

* You no longer need to use pip and virtualenv separately. They work together.  
* Managing a requirements.txt file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.  
* Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.  
* Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks arising from outdated components.  
* Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. $ pipenv graph).  
* Streamline development workflow by loading .env files.
